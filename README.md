### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
    - an ETL platform written in Python backend with 
    - a basic CLI for admin tasks, and 
    - Advanced CLI using prompt_toolkit and an
    - Electron React based GUI with server job scheduling and management, code editor and visual designer using Canvas and lots of fun 2D drawing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
  - Python ( I used to teach it to 1st years but was a bit rusty but fast typing has loosened the wheels.
  - React ( I have dabbled over the last couple of years and written some commercial code when I was managing a team that did most of the 'better' code;)
    Currently doing a lot of hook based React using Chakra-UI with typescript.
  - 2D drawing ( I have done SVG and 3D via DirectX in past lifetimes. Currently using Konvajs that seems like a great library that doesn't seem to have been adopted by many big companies. You should check it out if you need Canvas drawing rather than SVG.)
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
  - I am keen for a bit of open source work to get out of the house virtually and learn from others.
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... Noting current but I might open source my ETL Platform core in 2020.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you might think I can help out with.
